buildroot-rpi3-uboot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate an embedded
Linux system, including U-Boot, through cross-compilation for the Raspberry Pi 3.

Note that only the 64bit versions of the raspberry pi 3 are supported at the moment.

To build the 64bit Linux system for the raspberry pi 3, do the following:

1) run 'make raspberrypi3_64_uboot_defconfig'
2) optionally, change the buildroot configuration using 'make menuconfig'
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the sd card image in output/images, called 'sdcard.img'
